# Java Scanner Menu Framework

> **NOTE:** Due to new Java default restrictions, you must now add `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` to the compiler's arguments. 
> This is required for Jansi (the underlying library that interacts with the console). 
> You may follow the issue [here](https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues/301).
